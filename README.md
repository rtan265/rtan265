## Recent Projects
### SocialMediaBlocker
A [Chrome extension]() (soon!) that blocks social media websites (think facebook, instagram, linkedin) during work hours (7am - 7pm) due to me being so fidgety and checking them every so often. Currently waiting on Google to review my extension application so I can offer it to other people to use. Also allows users to add their own goal links, so they can focus on completing their goals if they do open up said social media websites.

### UpSkill
[UpSkill](https://github.com/rtan265/upskill) is a platform that offers live online lessons that are local with the added opportunity to network, aimed at those who have been made redundant as a result of quarantine and isolation. Our aim is to upskill, reskill and retool learners to help them re-enter the job market.

This project was built over the weekend of 17 July - 19 July as part of the 2020 [DEVS Hackathon](https://www.devs.org.nz/blog/DEVS-Hackathon). It has a working backend to store registrations to a MongoDB database. The frontend was built using ReactJs.

Tech Stack: MongoDB | Express | ReactJs | NodeJs

### Positive Vibes Only 
[Positive Vibes](https://positive-vibes-auckland.netlify.app/) is an online web application that allows users to post supportive, wholesome messages to help with the effects of the second lockdown in Auckland. This web application calls a sentiment analysis program from Microsoft Cognitive Services to analyse the messages that users post to ensure that they are positive.

### Personal Website
Built my [personal website](https://github.com/rtan265/rtan265.github.io) over a week during the Easter Break as a challenge to learn more about web development. Super happy to have created my website, but there's is still work to be done! Currently looking for a designer to help me design a better website so I can build a better looking personal website! 

Currently a work in progress!

### Krayon Kafe
[Krayon Kafe](https://github.com/rtan265/Krayon-Kafe) is an online web application that allows users to provide a location (e.g. Panmure, Ponsonby) that shows them the cafes around the area, as well as provide Google Map Markers that show them where the cafes are.

This project was built over the weekend of 1 August - 2 August, as part of the Create Camp hosted by [Summer of Tech](https://summeroftech.co.nz/) and [ANZ](https://www.anz.co.nz/personal/). This application uses the ZenbuAPI for location data, as well as the GoogleMaps JavaScript API to show users the location of the cafes queried.
